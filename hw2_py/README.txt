Files in this project:
main.py
preprocessor.py
ldapreprocessor.py
matrix.py
kmeans.py
similarity.py
evaluation.py
visualization.py


Installation:

The following Python libraries are used:

1. NLTK
2. spaCy
3. gensim
4. sklearn
5. matplotlib
6. pandas

$ pip install -U <name of library>

The spaCy library extension ‘en_core_web_sm’ is also used and can be installed as a package:
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


User Guide:

Start by typing "python main.py" at the command line. topics.txt (generated by the NER and sliding windows/g-grams
preprocessor) and Ltopics.txt (generated by the LDA preprocessor) are output to the same directory as main.py.

A document term matrix transformed by TF-IDF is generated and processed by the K-Means clustering algorithm. The
results are displayed visually.
